/** Linked List Construction
Write a DoublyLinkedList class that has a head and a tail , both of
which point to either a linked list Node or None / null . The class should
support:
- Setting the head and tail of the linked list.
- Inserting nodes before and after other nodes as well as at given
positions.
- Removing given nodes and removing nodes with given values;
- Searching for nodes with given values.
Each Node has an integer value as well as a prev node and a next
node, both of which can point to either another node or None / null.

Sample Usage:
/ / Assume the following linked list has already been created:
1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 4 <-> 5 
setHead (4): 4 <-> 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 5 // set the existing node with value 4 as the head
set Tail (6): 4 <-> 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 5 <-> 6 // set the existing node with value 6 as the tail
insertBefore (6, 3): 4 <-> 1 <-> 2 <-> 5 <-> 3 <-> 6 // move the existing node with value 3 before the existing node with value 6
insertAfter(6, 3): 4 <-> 1 <-> 2 <-> 5 <-> 3 <-> 6 <-> 3 // insert a new node with value 3 after the existing node with value 6
insertAtPosition(1, 3): 3 <-> 4 <-> 1 <-> 2 <-> 5 <-> 3 <-> 6 <-> 3 // insert a new node with value 3 in position 1
removeNodesWithValue(3): 4 <-> 1 <-> 2 <-> 5 <-> 6 // remove all nodes with value 3
remove(2): 4 <-> 1 <-> 5 <-> 6 // remove the existing node with value 2
containsNodeWithVa1ue(5} : true
